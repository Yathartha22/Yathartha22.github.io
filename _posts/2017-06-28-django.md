Well, it's been a long time that I haven't written about anything. So I thought to write about what I am learning for the past few days **Django**.

I will get started with the definition first

> _Django is a high level python web framework. It is free and open source, written in python._

Like any other framework, Django also supports MVC(**M**odel **V**iew **C**ontroller) pattern. It follows MVC closely, however, it does use its own logic in the implementation. Because the “C(**C**ontroller)” is handled by the framework itself and most of the excitement in Django happens in models, templates and views, Django is often referred to as an MTV(**M**odel **T**emplate **V**iew) framework.
Not going into much detail what MVC or MTV is, just know that Django’s View is more like the Controller in MVC, and MVC’s View is actually a Template in Django. Therefore the name MTV.

That was a bit of an introduction to what actually _Django_ is. The reason why I chose Django was that I was involved with Python(coding as well as open source) for quite a time so I thought why not try Python in web development, so I started with Django.

What I like the most about Django, is we can actually create dynamic websites really fast, you don't need to worry about most things, you just define your data model and off you go. With Django, you can take Web applications from concept to launch in a matter of hours. Django takes care of much of the hassle of Web development so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Another thing that I appreciate and like is Django's community and resources. It has a huge community ready to help anytime. Django's open source community Also it has it's resources are properly documented.Django's documentation

**Why Django?**


- **Ridiculously fast**


  _Django is designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible._

- **Fully loaded**

  
  _Django includes dozens of extras you can use to handle common Web development tasks. Django takes care of user authentication, content       administration, site maps, RSS feeds, and many more tasks — right out of the box._

- **Reassuringly secure**


  _Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and clickjacking. Its user authentication system provides a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords._

- **Exceedingly scalable**


  _Some of the busiest sites on the planet use Django’s ability to quickly and flexibly scale to meet the heaviest traffic demands._

- **Incredibly versatile**

  _Companies, organizations and governments have used Django to build all sorts of things — from content management systems to social networks   to scientific computing platforms._

I think if you are a _Python_ lover you should give _Django_ a try...!!  I will come up with more experiences with Django, till then All the best 👍 and Happy coding 😃
