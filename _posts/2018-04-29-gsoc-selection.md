Sorry for the late post!!

The results of **[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5583344046178304/#6097058637807616)** were out on 23 April 2018 and guess what I got selected and will be working under **[Sympy](http://sympy.org)** for the next 3 months. I will be working on my project, [Solvers: Completing Solveset](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kcZCdQuY3XxgHPuSA8vvwc6O8AbVZ-nYskMuXIia9hA/edit?usp=sharing), during this period. I am really excited to work with such an amazing organization. I would like to thank all the mentors especially [Aaron Meurer](https://github.com/asmeurer), [Christopher Smith](https://github.com/smichr), [Amit Kumar](https://github.com/aktech) and [Kalevi Suominen](https://github.com/jksuom) for guiding me in my proposal and PR's. My official mentor will be **Amit Kumar**.


The first phase is the _Community Bonding Period_, I will focussing on the following things before the coding period begans.


 - Setting up blog and synchronizing it with planet sympy.

 - Discussing possible means of communication, weekly meetings etc.

 - Planning the implementation of the project with Amit.

 - Familiarizing with the codebase of Sympy and see how it may help solving the problems while implementing the project.


I will be having my end sems and practicals during this period but I will try to accomplish the above tasks whenever I get time.

Looking forward for a wonderful summer ahead ðŸ˜„	!!
