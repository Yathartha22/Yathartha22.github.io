I have always been worried about my desktop's wallpaper. I find it a bit tedious to search the web for an image, download it and set it as my desktop's wallpaper. So I thought to write a `python script` that would do the job for me.

Being a bit enthusiast about space and astronomy, I thought to get wallpapers from NASA's official site, and therefore I wrote the script. The script actually gets the wallpaper from `NASA's APOD(Astronomy Picture Of the Day)` and sets it as your desktop wallpaper. So here is my github link to the script.

Till then enjoy with amazing and cool space pics from NASA ðŸ˜ƒ
