This week I continued to work on finalising the design of the `_transolve`. Following were the things discussed and implemented:
 
- The loop over the `rhs_s` was removed because `solveset` already has a loop and since `_transolve` is called within the loop therefore there won't be a case where there would be more than one argument in `rhs_s` inside `_transolve`.

- `pow_type()` was created to handle power type equations in `_transolve` but it turns out that power type equations will be handled in the `_invert()` itself, so it was repetitive to add again.

- The names of the solving helpers were improved to `_solve_class` from the previous `_class_solver`.

- Discussions with Amit and Chris led to the conclusion that `_transolve` should be completely made an internal function of `solveset`, i.e. it should not be used as an independent function. At first the thought was that it can be used as an independent function, but this created a problem of the code being repeated as that of `solveset`, so Chris suggested that `_transolve` should raise an error for equations that `solveset` can handle, but again this created problem, it would make unnnecessary complications in the code as we need to be very specific as to when and where raise an error.

- We decided to have same arguments for all the helpers. Be it identification or solving helper, both will take the equation and the variable as their arguments, with the choice that the helper can ignore to use any of the argument if not needed.
 

- There were a lot of improvement in the documentation as the design changed.

Apart from these changes work in implementing `log solver` is going on in parallel.
