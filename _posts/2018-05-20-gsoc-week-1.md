So the coding period started from 14 May 2018. So most of the days of the first week I spent was giving final exams and travelling. But now everything is over and I will be spending most of the time implementing what I have proposed for the first evaluations. I had a meeting with Amit during the community bonding period where we discussed :

 - Schedule and frequency of meetings.

 - How to proceed with implementing transolve, documenting and writing tests for it.


As of now I have looked few things:

 - How `_tsolve` works in `solve`.

 - How exponential and logarithmic equations are solved.

 - Filtering out the tests for the above.

 - Figuring out how the API would look like.

 - What will be the flow of `transolve`.

The last two points needs more discussions and planning. In the coming week I will try to figure it out by dicussing it with Amit and by the end I will try to make an initial commit to `transolve`.

Hope I execute the plan well!!
