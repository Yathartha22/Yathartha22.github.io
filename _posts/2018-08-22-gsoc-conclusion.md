Today's day started with receiving an email from Google. Here is a snapshot:

This left a big smile on my face ðŸ˜„

The past 3-4 months have been amazing and I have learnt a lot during the course of time. I would like to thank [Aaron](https://github.com/asmeurer), [Ondrej](https://github.com/certik) and the [SymPy](http://sympy.org) team for providing me with this opportunity, my mentor [Amit Kumar](https://github.com/aktech) for guiding me all through the phases and a special thanks to [Chris](https://github.com/smichr) who was not officially my mentor but was present all the time for reviweing my work and helping me complete the project successfully.

Here is what Amit has to say:

Though GSoC is completed I will be continuing my contribution in the developement of the software.
